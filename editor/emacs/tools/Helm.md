# Helm
* https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm

> **Helm** is an Emacs framework for incremental completions and narrowing selections. It helps to rapidly complete file names, buffer names, or any other Emacs interactions requiring selecting an item from a list of possible choices. Helm is a fork of **anything.el**, which was originally written by Tamas Patrovic and can be considered to be its successor. **Helm** cleans the legacy code that is leaner, modular, and unchained from constraints of backward compatibility.
