> Idris: A Language for Type-Driven Development
>
> In type-driven development, types are tools for constructing programs. We treat the type as the **plan** for a program, and use the compiler and type checker as our assistant, guiding us to a complete program that satisfies the type. The more expressive the type is that we give up front, the more confidence we can have that the resulting program will be correct.
>
> In Idris, **types are first-class constructs** in the language. This means types can be passed as arguments to functions, and returned from functions just like any other value, such as numbers, strings, or lists. This is a small but powerful idea, enabling:
>
> - relationships to be expressed between values; for example, that two lists have the same length.
> - assumptions to be made explicit and checked by the compiler. For example, if you assume that a list is non-empty, Idris can ensure this assumption always holds before the program is run.
> - if desired, properties of program behaviour to be formally stated and proven.
