/* Apart from comments and blank lines, which are
ignored, Prolog programs consist of a number of
clauses. A clause is always terminated by a full
stop. It may run over more than one line, or there
may be several on the same line, separated by at
least one space. There are two types of clause:
facts and rules. dog(tom) is an example of a fact */
